# ToDoList-Intermediate

This is a very simple Todo list created using JavaScript.

It has 4 commands - new,list,delete and quit.
  Command "new" allows you add a new Todo.
  Command "list" allows you to list all Todos that are currently on the list.
  Command "delete" allows you to delete a specific Todo from the list.
  Command "quit" allows you to exit the app.
  
The app stores all Todos in an array. A "while" loop is being used until You type "quit" command.

For commands "new", "delete" and "list", "if" and "else if" statements are being used to determined what the next step will be.

For commands "new" and "delete", .push and .splice methods are being used
to add and/or remove a todo.

Command "delete" will ask for an index number of a specific Todo.

Using JavaScript console, You will be able to see all Todos and you will be able to see a confirmation when you quit the app.
 
This app is a part of my JavaScript learning process. I am currently learning JavaScript using "The Web Developer Bootcamp" course on Udemy.
